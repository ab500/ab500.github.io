title: Hello World! 
---

It's been a while since I've had a blog! I graduated college, started
a career, and got really busy. I'm going to change that. I
enjoy writing and there's a lot I'd like to share with the world. I've
been developing software as far back as I can remember and along the way I've
gained a lot of opinions, thoughts, and experience. I attribute most
of what I know to knowledge gleamed from a countless number of articles, posts,
and documented authored by others. I want to give back and share what I've 
learned!

I make no promises, but with any luck I'll be able to author something interesting
every couple weeks or so.
