title: Hello World! 
---

It's been a while since I've had a blog! I graduated college, started
a career, and got really busy. I'm going to change that. I
enjoy writing and there's a lot I'd like to share with the world. I've
been developing software as far back as I can remember and along the way I've
gained a lot of opinions, thoughts, and experience. I attribute most
of what I know to knowledge stolen from a countless number of articles, posts,
and documents authored by others and I want to give back.

I make no promises, but with any luck I'd like to author something interesting
every week or so.

The last time I authored a blog I stuck strictly with really dry technical material.
Part of me still thinks that's what the internet could use most, but this time I
want to be a little more open-ended when it comes to topics. My passion in life is
technology in every sense. The nitty-gritty details, how to approach it, how it affects
our lives, the implications it has, and the policies and politics that surround it.

Our community is increasingly under the watch 
glasses of both governments and the average citizen. Issues like net neutrality,
privacy, copyright, and the freedom of information are being hotly debated and policy
is being created that will have far-reaching effects long into the future. 

At the same time we continue to push out the limits of what's possible. Year after year
the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to improve and the
state of the art continues to march forward. We gallop with seemly reckless abandon
as the impossible continues to crumble.

It's all so very exciting to be a part of and I'd like to share some of that excitement with
you. Onward we go!
