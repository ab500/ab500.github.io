I'm Andrew Robinson. I live and play in Seattle as a software developer during the day
and a typical 20-something, aimless young adult during the night. 

I typically spend my
days obsessing over cache-locality, forming opinions of my colleagues exclusively by
how well they've mastered C++11, and lobbing off-color insults over the fence at those who 
dare code in Javascript while concealing a tinge of jealousy.

As far back as I can remember I've known how to program. I started when I was young
with languages like Visual Basic 5.0 and C. I made simple programs that did simple
things. At some point my parents bought a Lego Mindstorms set, which came with this
neat little programmable device called an RCX. It also came an awesome 
community of hackers who had built all kinds of wonderful
compilers and tools around it for me to explore. 

I remember registering for the LEGO community forum, using my real birthday, and being endlessly
frustrated for 3 whole years because our laws didn't allow individuals under 13 to
post and their forum didn't allow you to change your birthday. 
Frustrations aside, I spent countless hours tinkering with that brick, trying different things out and 
figuring out how to take an idea and manifest it into the world. It was addicting.

From there I've followed a pretty wild path. If you can name it I've
probably written or hacked on one. Low-level embedded
devices, kernel drivers, web infrastructure, e-commerce and line-of-business apps,
networking stacks, compiler and parsers, advanced artificial intelligence and 
machine learning, distributed systems, signal processing, high-performance 
graphics and rendering.
I've seen it all at this point as I've navigated and stumbled around in a 
countless number of languages, worked for an alarming number of companies, and
written a truly absurd amount of code.

I believe pushing technology forward is one of the most interesting things one
can do with their lives. Particularly computer science has always captivated me.
If you believe in a deterministic world then you'll believe the way we think
and in fact everything that gives rise to that fleeting phenomenon we call
consciousness is understandable, describable, and
copyable. To me, computer science is the study of how we do that. Curiosity
is fundamental to who we are and computer science is all about building 
the machines that enable understanding and exploration. Algorithms are the ultimate 
levers by which we pry apart and manipulate our world and through them
anything becomes possible. How couldn't that get you excited?
